# Description

This is a full-stack web application built with Typescript, Express.js, React, and PostgreSQL.

It was created as an individual project task for Hack Your Future Denmark's curriculum.

The backend of the app was deployed on Railway, while the frontend was deployed on Vercel.

The main functionalities of this website are:

- Displaying the meals in the database
- Searching for a meal
- Making a reservation
- Leaving a review

# Technologies Used

- What I Learned

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. Some of the challenges I faced include building a Star component for leaving a rating for a meal, a Modal component, and a Burger Menu for mobile displays.

Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of React, CSS Modules, and Frontend Development in general. I also learned how to work with Express.js, KnexJS, and PostgreSQL to build a full-stack web application.

In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.
